HEALTH CAMP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

With the technology advancements, growing population and the rise in cost of living, health care is not really affordable for certain classes of the society. This project aims at helping homeless people or elderly people by providing, if not high-end medical help, at least the minimum health care or support by involving hospitals, health camps, voluntary organisations and sponsors in the picture.

The application has a voluntary login page who enrols a patient by entering his details and registering with one of the labs that are available at his convenience. The lab operator then performs the required tests(eg:general health checkup) on the patient and generates a test report. This report is now forwarded to the hospital to analyse the patient’s situation. Upon examining the patient’s situation, the doctor goes through the test results and states the condition. The health camp organiser receives the reports and assigns a doctor so that he can start the medication process. Doctor logs in to his account, checks the patient reports and prepares a list of medicines that the patient has to take. The pharmacist checks the medicines that the patient is prescribed with and adds them to the cart to generate a bill. The accountant can now view the bill and the fundraiser will be able to see the whole expense incurred for each patient. Now, the sponsor can check the list of patients who are in need of funds and can make a donation of any amount he wishes to. This can be tracked by the fundraiser to see how much funds he has raised for each patient.
